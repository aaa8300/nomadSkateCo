# Nomad Skate Co. Mock Client Website

## Overview  
This is a personal practice project where I designed and built a fictional website for a made-up skateboard brand called *Nomad Skate Co.*. I created the site to explore modern web design techniques and improve my frontend development skills. The goal was to build something creative and fully responsive while experimenting with layout, styling, and effects.

## What I Did  
- Built all components using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**
- Designed the layout, typography, and color scheme to reflect the brand's urban aesthetic
- Implemented **parallax scrolling** and smooth transitions using CSS
- Ensured full **mobile responsiveness** and accessibility

## Key Features  
- Custom design with urban-inspired branding  
- Parallax scrolling for enhanced interactivity  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users  
- Clean and accessible code structure  
- Fully functional, multi-section layout  

## Challenges and What I Learned  
A major challenge was implementing parallax scrolling with my little knowledge of web design. I researched techniques, tested multiple approaches, and refined the final effect using layered backgrounds and scroll-based styling.
I also learned to manage time effectively, solve problems through research, and translate a creative brief into a fully functional product.
