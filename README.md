# Nomad Skate Co. Mock Client Website

## Overview  
This website was created as part of a web development program through America On Tech. The challenge was to follow a *mock* client brief and redesign the site for *Nomad Skate Co.*, a fictional skateboard brand with a street art-inspired, community-driven identity.  

The goal was to create a bold, artistic, and responsive site that aligned with the brand's vision while demonstrating strong frontend development skills.

## What I Did  
- Built all components using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**
- Designed the layout, typography, and color scheme to reflect the brand's urban aesthetic
- Implemented **parallax scrolling** and smooth transitions using CSS
- Ensured full **mobile responsiveness** and accessibility

## Key Features  
- Custom design with urban-inspired branding  
- Parallax scrolling for enhanced interactivity  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users  
- Clean and accessible code structure  
- Fully functional, multi-section layout  

## Challenges and What I Learned  
A major challenge was implementing parallax scrolling with my little knowledge of web design. I researched techniques, tested multiple approaches, and refined the final effect using layered backgrounds and scroll-based styling.
I also learned to manage time effectively, solve problems through research, and translate a creative brief into a fully functional product.
